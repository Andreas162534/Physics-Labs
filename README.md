# Physics-Labs

Experimental methods and gear:
- oszilloscopes
- signal amplifiers
- optics (lasers, mirrors)
- liquid nitrogen

Used Analysing techniques:
- Python
  - plotting (matplotlib)
  - fitting arbitrary functions to data (scipy.optimize.curve_fit)
  - chi-square fitting  (scipy.stats.chi2)
- statistics
  - calculation mean, standard deviation, deviation of mean (numpy)
  - calculating systematic error and statistical error
- LaTeX
  - write protocolls (Overleaf)
  - format plots, design layout, allocate pictures properly 



light source Lab: 
I analysed discret and continous light sources by comparing the respective spectra.


Fourier optics Lab: 
I analysed diffraction patterns of single and double slits.
I further applied the concept of Fouriersynthesis.

Temperature Measurement Lab written in english
I used different measurement techniques like a gas thermometer, a platinum resistance thermometer, a infrared inferometer and a PtRh-thermocouple
I measured the boiling temperature of liquid nitrogen.
